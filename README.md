# Evomons
HackFS project => NFT + Defi let's go!




Here's what our team is working on so far:

**Name**: Evomons **Description**: NFT + defi => A real pixel based creature experience with evolutions, Do you wanna Catch em all? **Idea**: Evomons is a new game in town based on a new token.The main motive is to combine NFT and Defi together.I am thinking of having 88mph to make these pixel based creatures that evolve and battle to give a real Pokemon like experience.if i have time maybe some wearables would work.I want to have this finally inside decentraland to work as pets.
